Tech Industry is Harming Itself


Tech is making our world a better place to live in ...
But... 

Tech may ruin people's livelihoods 


We're going to an extent that there won't be enough jobs for people to do as tech is taking over everything 

As tech is solving industrial needs for manpower, it is also keeping out its own people (the tech savvy).


At IBTC (Ibadan Techies Club), when we were discussing about this challenging issue when I posed the question to them, one of their top tech guy said that "a senior software engineer can handle a project all on his own". Even look at most projects, it's been made by a team of 5 to 10 Devs.


Whereas we're having a lot of people going into tech industry right now.


We experienced giant tech companies like Facebook, Google, Microsoft etc even lay off many workers.


One thing about tech products is that it can be self regulatory (I mean a Autonomous systems). Perhaps it'll only need some touches when there's need for upgrading or complete overhauling.


So, how many jobs would be available for people to earn their living ?


Recently, Christine Amanpour of CNN interviewed Geoffrey Hinton who is said to be the father of AI. He said he regretted creating such technology


What can people in Tech Industry do to survive in the long run ? And securing the future for upcoming tech people... ?
