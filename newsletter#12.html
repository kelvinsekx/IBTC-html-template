##Welcome to a new month,

This month has been filled with challenges for me as a person and director of a club. But hope yours hasn't been the same!

Permit me to leave the club stories for a later section of The Club Update and let's boooouuugie!!

## THE WEEK IN REVIEW
In the tech scene this week, there hasn't been so much aside from the techies calling themselves out as we discussed last week. Njoku, the 19 years old Lazerpay founder, was seen calling Samuel Akinosho out again. This time he was found creating some new profiles of himself.

To get a hold of this discussion properly please read [our last newsletter#11](https://buttondown.email/BadTechyes/archive/ibtc-fridayout-newsletter11/).

## STUFF THAT ARE WORTH YOUR READ

The react beta docs did a good justice on the useEffect hook and some of the changes to see with the hook in the future.

[Angel.co stats on digital/product marketing and growth](https://angel.co/job-collections/5-companies-with-revolutionary-marketing-strategies-hiring-now)<br>
Seems like product marketing and growth are the next big thing to happen. There are just so many open positions and a scarcity of resources and personnel in this field. *Bonus, It came with top companies to apply to.*

## CLUB UPDATE
Last newsletter, we promised to announce dates for our next meetups. Unfortunately, things didn't turn out as expected. Everyone is hard at work to get everything back at work.

Last week, we talked about the major reason for the delay being that we are making plans and dragging funds for a year, unlike our initial monthly schedule. When we are done, it will be big news.

We created a WhatsApp group for alert and quick information purposes. This came as a consensus from the previous meetup. The reason is to serve as a quick channel to send information to our members, this could have quickly helped to communicate alternative routes to our venue during the last meetup gridlock. [Please join the WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/HfVuTnWjgpo6CtVeyWsnR2)
