##Ayooo!!!!
 Last week was exciting because for no other reason other than the club resumed!!. A big thank you to everyone who took the time to come around ðŸ˜—. The next meetup is even bigger as it would be having the first-ever technical designer meetup in Ibadan.

Let's skip the excitement for the Club's Update Section and get to business.

## THE WEEK GIST IN REVIEW
One of the most celebrated Black VC founders, Arlan Hamilton, was in the gist.<br>
It is noteworthy to add VC firms are experiencing a funds freeze generally.

Also, Google products are confusing all of us now ðŸ¤£ (looks like many of their solutions are just addressing the same problem).

## STUFF THAT ARE WORTH YOUR READ

[Get the result of the Stackoverflow Developer Survey for 2022](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/22/asked-and-answered-the-results-for-the-2022-developer-survey-are-here/)<br>
The state of software development has since had a trend, peep into its future.

[Learn how to interview the interviewer](https://www.github.com/readme/guides/technical-interviews)<br>
Mental health struggle is real. As the excitement of getting a new job, the exhaustion of being in a bad working space can be far worse. You'd better interview the interviewer.

[The instanceof operator is least talked about. You should still know about it](https://www.baeldung.com/java-instanceof#:~:text=What%20Is%20the%20instanceof%20Operator%3F%20instanceof%20is%20a,operator%20because%20it%20compares%20the%20instance%20with%20type.)<br>Instanceof operator is a binary operator that is very useful with checking object instances, most especially errors'.

## CLUB'S UPDATE
Last week Saturday, we held a meetup and if you missed it, you sure missed something. Our next meetup comes even bigger as we plan to commence technical meetings going forward (the whole speaker setting). Stay tune to get further info.

Also, the directors made a consensus to end the open invitation to the club's WhatsApp group: The new condition is that only members who have attended a meetup can get an invite to join our WhatsApp group. **This is to avoid spam or potential fraud for our highly valued members**.

Thanks for understanding.
