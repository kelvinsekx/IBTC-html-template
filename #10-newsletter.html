##Wazzaaaaping friends!

I missed you last Friday,

Last week was one hectic week for not only me but the club. We had only a week to rest for the next meetup which held last Saturday. To make matter worse, The students of the university of Ibadan completely blocked the Ojoo-UI road during their protest.

We apologize to all who could not attend or were heavily impacted by the gridlock.

## THE WEEK IN REVIEW

Another tech bubble, most popular as dot-com bubble, right in our eyes in 2022., [the stocks are down, crypto is down, NFT sales too and VCs funds are dropping too](https://twitter.com/nbashaw/status/1522666477295341569?t=MI1WGJErJoq1KXgi87WKuQ&s=19) OMG. Since the cause of this one is  [free money isn't free again](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-layoffs-hiring-freezes-increase-cheap-money-shrinks-175749210.html), may be we can call it tech cracker instead of the bubble.

For the past 5 years, tech jobs have been on the increase with even the crazier part accompanied with multiple increase in salary.

Well the tech ecosystem is becoming saturated and there seem to be a tougher time ahead of us. The hard part is getting the first tech job might be even difficult as it has been.  Since Rose survived the first dot-com bubble, you should take [her advice](https://twitter.com/rose_w/status/1524004922097733632?t=LsmxZkHTtx8DnC4QabeDJw&s=19) seriously. As a start up or business owner who would be seeking fund this time, [David Sacks forecast and advice](https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/1522745450347958272?t=HonLJsIMXejIUWCAoydR0w&s=19) would be something you would want to look into.


## STUFF THAT ARE WORTH YOUR READ


## CLUB UPDATE
Last meetup number was heavily impaired by the students protest and we are putting plans on how to control such behaviour in the future, if possible we could put in plans to change venue going forward.

Next meetup: we haven't reached the conclusion for the next meetup. This is because the community lead, kelvinsekx, would be having multiple meetings with the clubs backer this will run from this week to the next.
Our next meetup however would most probably be the last saturday this month or the first saturday from next month. We hope this would give us 2 weeks gap at least to rest and plan going forward

We created a whatapp group for alert and quick information purpose. This came as a consensus from last meetup. The reason is to serve as a quick channel to send information to our members, this is could have quickly helped to communicate alternative routes to our venue during lastmeetup gridlock.
