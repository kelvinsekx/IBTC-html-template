##Where are your missing siblings.

Hello!

It has since been a long week after our first meetup. In fact, I have been longing to reach you.

Last Saturday, April 30, the first Ibadan Techies club meetup was held. If you were not around, I am sorry you missed. You are one of our missing siblings üòÇ and we need you back.

Please help us share and tell people about this newsletter. You can use this link [https://buttondown.email/BadTechyes](https://buttondown.email/BadTechyes).

<div style="background: hsl(193,31%, 50%, 0.06); padding: 3px 6px; font-size: 93%; margin: 39px 0px;">
Hello! You're getting this mail because you subscribed to be a part of Ibadan Techies Club. If you don't want to get these emails, please opt out by sending "<em>no longer interested</em>" to this mail. I only want to send this if you look forward to getting them.

## THE WEEK IN REVIEW
I don‚Äôt know what happened this week üôÑ but there was almost nothing buzzing in the gist side of tech. Gist or no gist üòÇ we will move on. (I know somebody would have said Amen to that)

## STUFF THAT ARE WORTH YOUR READ

- [Make a nav scroll animation with CSS](https://youtu.be/nTtUg8EuJ_8). <br>
The short video, 6 minutes thereabout, would show you how to add smooth nav and page transition all with a css one-liner.

- [What React closure stale problems are, examples and how to solve them.](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/hooks-dependencies-and-stale-closures?utm_source=reactdigest&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=354)
<br>This article written by one of react-query maintainers was the article of the town this week.
<br><br>Ever since react implemented hooks like useEffect, useCallback, useMemo and useLayoutEffect, even the experienced react developers are having headache with stale closure. The dependency array has in fact not been as rosy as it seems in addressing it. This article would help any experienced react developer in unravelling this trouble.
<br>(Preferable for experienced react developers)

- Not until recently, most job description has **‚Äúyou must understand agile methodologies‚Äù** as if it's one very difficult skill. As in üòÇ, I could remember I skipped applying to some jobs when I see the way it was boldly written. This is because I did not understand what it meant and I thought hell-no this is another big thing to learn. Well it isn't. 
<br><br>
 [Navin reddy was able to do justice on what scrum, sprints and backlogs are in this short video](https://youtu.be/oTZd2vo3FQU).  After seeing the video, you can read [a lengthy discussion about what scrum and sprints are](https://insightspotter.com/what-is-the-difference-between-sprint-and-scrum/?amp). Now go apply with some boldness üòéü§≠.

- Imposter syndrome happens to everyone, [Emma caught one recently](https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian/status/1521025783543738369?t=2daF0RRNNncumwNuYXwtxw&s=19). <br><br>Considering Emma Bostian is a senior engineer at spotify and in fact a twitter verified developer at that, she had the syndrome this week. I like to see imposter syndrome as a catarrh, it comes and go, but when you don't treat it the first time or develop a pattern to treat it, it can develop into headache, burnt eyes etc.

## CLUB UPDATE
