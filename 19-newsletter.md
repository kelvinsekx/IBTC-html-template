## THE WEEK GIST IN REVIEW

### Elon is putting Twitter in soup üò£
Just like you must have heard, Twitter is suing Elon Musk for refusing to agree to the contract to buy the giant media app.<br>
There is not much news there except that this is not very good for the Ad income of Twitter. [Adage](https://adage.com) claims this unrest would [negatively affect Ad sales on the platform as Advisers no longer know what they are paying for thus holding their money back](https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/twitters-elon-musk-drama-has-its-ad-sales-disarray-advertisers-say/2422996).

### Is Facebook copying Twitter now?

Facebook is adding another feature‚Ä¶.news feed.<br>
Unlike the age feeds you‚Äôve got, this one would only contain posts from your friends in chronological order (I‚Äôm one of those who wanted this feature ü§£). People keep asking for this but social media experts have kept preaching the feature will be a disaster considering the number of friends an average user has  - there will be so much in the feed and at too much frequency it will be a waste.

### Congratulations üòÅ Nigeria‚Äôs House of Assembly passes the Nigeria Startup Bill

Looks the God of Startups has finally shone his light on use. We are only [waiting for the Presidency assent for it to become a law](https://techcabal.com/2022/07/28/nigerias-house-of-reps-pass-the-nigeria-startup-bill/).

## STUFF THAT ARE WORTH YOUR READ

[Cassidoo Talk on functional programming at Hey meetup, UK](https://youtu.be/XGNYDjyD6G8)<br>
Functional languages was rated as the most loved programming languages according to Stack overflow Survey, 2021. Cassidoo gave a good introduction to functional programming in this video on demand at Hey, UK.

[How we learned to, and build website in 1997](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/postscript/its-1997-and-you-want-to-build-a-website/)<br>
We had a way to learn to build website, and few options to build them, come look at it üòÅ.

[What the hell is character encoding about](https://hackernoon.com/character-encoding-demystified-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ascii-unicode-utf-8)<br>
Have you ever wondered how exactly a computer interprets letters like A, B, C‚Ä¶ or Chinese characters like ÂêÉ, or even some emojis like üòÜ and ü§™? <br>
Well, on your html tags if you've seen the charset attribute, you too have been encoding chars.<br>
Be intrigued with one of the best article on the definition and difference of Hashing, Encoding and Encryption written by the King of security themselves, Auth0

[Encoding, Encryption and Hashing do not mean same thing](https://auth0.com/blog/encoding-encryption-hashing/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=sc&utm_campaign=security)<br>
Translating data from one format to another with an open mechanism so that parties involved can better understand is **encoding**. While Hashing is not reversible, Encoding and Encryption are.  üòÇ It's really amazing.

## CLUB'S UPDATE
Last week Saturday, we held a meetup and if you missed it, you sure missed something. Our next meetup comes even bigger as we plan to commence technical meetings going forward (the whole speaker setting). Stay tune to get further info.

Also, the directors made a consensus to end the open invitation to the club's WhatsApp group: The new condition is that only members who have attended a meetup can get an invite to join our WhatsApp group. **This is to avoid spam or potential fraud for our highly valued members**.

Thanks for understanding.
